The project was very interesting, even if unsatisfying with how I couldn't get certain details exact. The fonts were the most annoying part of this: I couldn't get them just right at the end.
The most painful part of this assignment was getting the quiz portion looking correct. Pretty much anything that could go wrong, did go wrong. Everything else was relatively smooth.
It's a very interesting idea for a project, though. Great job coming up with this.
